The following table summarizes the different annotations and what they enable. If you are familiar with and prefer the JPA annotations then feel free to skip to the next section:

.Micronaut Data Annotations
[cols=2*]
|===
|*Annotation*
|*Description*

|ann:data.annotation.AutoPopulated[]
|Meta annotation for a value that should be auto-populated by Micronaut Data (such as time stamps and UUIDs)

|ann:data.annotation.DateCreated[]
|Allows assigning a data created value (such as a `java.time.Instant`) prior to an insert

|ann:data.annotation.DateUpdated[]
|Allows assigning a last updated value (such as a `java.time.Instant`) prior to an update

|ann:data.annotation.GeneratedValue[]
|Specifies that the property value is generated by the database and not included in inserts

|ann:data.annotation.Id[]
|Specifies the ID of an entity

|ann:data.annotation.EmbeddedId[]
|Specifies an embedded ID of an entity

|ann:data.annotation.MappedEntity[]
|Specifies the entity is mapped to the database

|ann:data.annotation.MappedProperty[]
|Used to customize the column name, definition and data type

|ann:data.annotation.Relation[]
|Used to specify a relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)

|ann:data.annotation.Transient[]
|Used to specify a property is transient

|===

In the case of using JPA only a subset of annotations are supported including the following:

* `@Table`
* `@Id`
* `@Column`
* `@Transient`
* `@JoinTable`
* `@OneToMany`
* `@OneToOne`
* `@ManyToOne`
* `@ManyToMany`
* `@Embedded`
* `@Embeddable`

Again Micronaut Data JDBC is not an ORM, but instead a simple data mapper so many of the concepts in JPA simply don't apply, however for users familiar with these annotations it is handy being able to use them.
